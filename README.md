Sales Forecast Prediction (Python)

A reproducible, beginner-friendly project for forecasting sales using Python. The notebook walks through data prep, feature engineering, model training with gradient-boosted trees, and evaluation using standard regression metrics.

📌 What’s inside

Clear, step-by-step Jupyter notebook: Sales Forecast Prediction - PythonGH.ipynb

End-to-end ML workflow (load → explore → engineer → model → evaluate)

Model: XGBoost Regressor (xgboost.XGBRegressor)

Metrics: RMSE (via sklearn.metrics.mean_squared_error)

Visuals: Exploratory plots and prediction vs. actual charts (Matplotlib/Seaborn)

🗂️ Repository structure

Sales Forecast Prediction - PythonGH.ipynb — main notebook with the full pipeline

data/ — (optional) place your raw CSV(s) here

outputs/ — (optional) figures, artifacts, and model outputs

Tip: If your dataset is large or private, don’t commit it; add /data to .gitignore.

📦 Requirements

Python 3.10+

Core libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

Modeling: scikit-learn, xgboost

Install in a fresh environment: pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost

🚀 Quickstart

Clone this repo

Place your dataset in data/ (or update the notebook path)

Open the notebook: jupyter notebook "Sales Forecast Prediction - PythonGH.ipynb"

Run cells top-to-bottom; tweak parameters as needed

🧭 Workflow overview

Load & Clean

Import CSV(s) and parse dates if available

Handle missing values / outliers

Explore

Summary statistics, trends, and seasonality checks

Visualize distributions and correlations

Feature Engineering

Create date-based features (year, month, dayofweek, lag/rolling if applicable)

One-hot encode categoricals (if present)

Train/validation split with train_test_split

Modeling (XGBoost Regressor)

Train baseline XGB model

Optional: hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, max depth, estimators, subsample, colsample_bytree)

Evaluation

Compute RMSE

Plot predicted vs actual to assess fit and bias

Export / Save

Save figures to outputs/

(Optional) Persist model with joblib for reuse

📊 Metrics

Primary: RMSE (root mean squared error)

(Optional) Add MAE, MAPE, and R² if your use case benefits

Lower RMSE indicates better predictive performance in the same units as the target (sales).

🔧 Configuration

Target column: sales (rename in the notebook if yours differs)

Feature set: Update the X = ... block to include your columns

Paths: Ensure your dataset path matches your local file structure

📝 Reproducibility

Fix random seeds in train_test_split and the XGB model for consistent runs

Log your library versions:

python --version

pip freeze > requirements.txt (optional)

📌 Notes & tips

Start with a simple baseline (e.g., mean/last value) to quantify lift

If your data is strictly time-ordered, use a time-series split (no leakage)

Consider lag features and rolling statistics for richer temporal signal

Monitor overfitting: compare train vs validation RMSE and inspect residuals

🗺️ Roadmap

 Add time-series cross-validation (e.g., TimeSeriesSplit)

 Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV or Optuna

 Feature importance plots and SHAP explanations

 Model persistence and simple API/CLI for batch scoring
